Weâ€™ve had wonderful experiences although not without some challenges, mostly network related. But overall, great efforts to keep the children engaged and also keep pace with the school calendar for the year. We truly appreciate and pray that God rewards everyone abundantly in Jesus name, Amen. Thank you.',
